**INTRODUCTION**

** Preliminary—**In Sanskrit any literary composition is generally termed Kavya. This kavya is of two kinds— 1. Drisya (दृश्य) and 2. Sravya (श्रब्य). The ‘seeable’literary writings such as the drama belong to the former group, while the ‘hearable’ones comprising of Prose (गद्य), Poetry (पद्य) and the Champu (Prose interspersed with poetry), belong to the latter. The पद्य or metrical composition again is of two kinds in accordance with its length—1. Mahakavyas (Long poems) and 2. Khanda kavyas (Short poems). As illustrations of the former we may cite Kali-dasa’s Raghuvamsa, Bharavi’s Kiratarjuniya etc. and of the latter, Kalidasa’s Meghaduta, Amaru’s Amaru Sataka etc.

 **The Raghuvamsa—** The Raghuvamsa is a Mahakavya dealing with the story of Raghu’s race, in 19 cantos, a brief analysis of which is as follows:—

** I–II.**King Dilipa is childless and on the advice of Vasistha propitiates the celestial cow Nandini. After some time the queen becomes enciente.

** III–IV.**Raghu is born, educated, married and installed on the throne. He conquers the whole earth; and performs many glorious deeds and a Visvajit sacrifice, during which he distributes all his wealth to the last pie.

** V–VIII.**Aja is born and grows to a marriageable age. He goes as a suitor to the svavamvara of Indumati, who chooses him as her husband. Aja is married and installed as king. Indumati dies suddenly and Aja’s lamentations are highly pathetic. He departs from this world when his son Dasaratha grows of age.

 **IX.** Dasaratha is cursed by a sage ‘to suffer पुत्रशोक’.

 **X.** Gods appeal to Vishnu to destroy the demon Ravana. Four sons are born to Dasaratha.

 **XI.** While guarding the sacrifice of Visvamitra, Rama

and Lakshmana kill Tataka and others. Rama and his brothers are married. Rama vanquishes Parasurama, the brahmin warrior.

 **XII.** Rama is exiled. Dasaratha dies, and Sita is abducted by Ravana who is later killed by Rama in a momentous fight.

 **XIII.** Rama flies back to Ayodhya in the aerial car Pushpaka and is received by Bharata.

 **XIV.** Rama becomes king and begins his happy reign. In course of time Sita becomes pregnant and is anxious to visit the penance groves once again. By about the same time, news is brought to him that people are talking ill of him for having accepted Sita as his queen in spite of her having lived in Ravana’s palace for some time. This makes him feel that he must abandon Sita, although he was quite aware of her innocence. Hence, he orders Lakshmana to take Sita to the forest and leave her at Valmiki’s hermitage Lakshmana carries out the order. Valmiki finding Sita in a forlorn state gives her shelter in his hermitage.

 **XV.** Sita delivers twin boys. Rama prepares to perform an Asvamedha. The horse is let loose but haltered by Sita’s sons Lava and Kusa. Rama comes to fight. But Valmiki presents Sita who establishes her chastity by a terrible ordeal which silences all scandal and she is taken back by her husband. There is a curious dialogue between Death and Rama. Rama ascends to Heaven.

 **XVI.**(1) Kusa is elected king by his brothers and cousins (seven in all) and Kusavati is assigned as his capital. (2–3) The eight princes— their rule, charity etc.(4) Once in the dead of night, Kusa, lying awake on his bed, beholds the guardian deity of Ayodhya. (5) She hails victory and salutes him. (6–8) Kusa, astonished at her appearance there, asks a few questions about her. (9–22) In reply she informs him that she is the presiding deity of his ancestral capital Ayodhya, pictures to him the deplorable and deserted state of the city and requests him to return to the same city. (23) Kusa consents to do so and she disappears. (24) He announces the event in the assembly

next day. (25) Kusa makes over Kusavati to Brahmins and sets out to Ayodhya with all the army. (26–34) Description of the army and the march towards Ayodhya. (35) He arrives at the bank of Sarayu. (36–37) and encamps his exhausted forces at the outskirts of the city. (38) Ayodhya is made quite new by artisans. (39) The city is duly worshipped. (40) The king enters the palace and assigns different mansions to all his followers. (41–42) The splendour of Ayodhya. (43–53) Description of summer. (54) The king’s desire to sport in the Sarayu (river) in the company of his wives. (55–67) The water-sport of the women folk. (68–71) The king joins them in the sport. (72) The celestial armlet of Kusa which he had obtained from his father drops down and sinks in the water during the sport. (73) The king finishes the sport and afterwards finds his arm without the ornament. (74–75) Distressed at that, he orders for a search of the entire river by divers, (76) who return unsuccessful and inform him that Kumuda, the Naga king living in a pool there, must have taken it. (77) Thereupon Kusa prepares to shoot the Garutmata missile at the Naga, (78–80) when the Naga comes out of the pool having in front of him a maiden and holding the ornament in his hand; seeing this Kusa withdraws the missile. (81–86) Kumuda salutes him, begs his pardon, explains to him how his sister out of curiosity took the ornament while it dropped down, returns it to him and offers along with it the maiden, *i.e.*, his sister, in marriage to him as an atonement for her offence. (87–88) King Kusa marries her. Both he and Kumuda live as friends thereafter.

 **XVII.** Kusa has a son Atithi who becomes king when Kusa is killed in a battle with a giant.

 **XVIII.**A list of the successors of Atithi.

 **XIX.** Agnivarna’s reign and his sudden death. His queen becomes the regent in behalf of her unborn child, as she was then an expectant mother.

Here the poem ends quite abruptly.

** Kalidasa— His date:—** There are only a few tantalising legends which have to speak about the life and date of our poet, though none of the legends is reliable. If one legend

makes him the contemporary of Bhavabhuti, another makes him the court poet of Bhojaraja of Dhara. But the tradition that he was one of the Nine Jems¹ of Vikramaditya’s court seems to have some truth about it. No doubt some scholars have rejected even this as totally baseless; but many are inclined to believe that Kalidasa’s patron must have been Vikramaditya. It is not unlikely that Kalidasa has paid his tribute to this patron of his, in the title of his play Vikramorvasiam. But as there have been several Vikramadityas, this tradition by itself does not help to fix the date of Kalidasa. One king Vikramaditya founded the era known after him which commences from 57 B.C. A good many scholars are inclined to think that it is very likely that this king was our poet’s patron. In support of this view, among other arguments, Mr. Pandit points out that Agnimitra, son of Pushpamitra who founded the Maurya dynasty in 160 B.C., is the hero of the Malavikagnimitra, being a historic person and a contemporary of our poet. Internal evidences are not wanting to strengthen this. The law of inheritence as detailed in the Sakuntalam Act VI, that the property of a person who died childless would go to the king, was current in or about the first century B.C. Moreover, the Bauddha poet Asvaghosha who is placed in 78 A.D. has in all likelihood borrowed his ideas from Kalidasa, as the latter has been recognised as an original poet borrowing his subjects only from ancient authors like Valmiki. These tend to show that Kalidasa lived in the first century B.C. The date is approximate, as it has not yet been finally accepted. That is why, if Dr. Peterson holds that “Kalidasa stands near the beginning of the Christian era, if indeed, he does not overtop it,”Dr. Kern places him in the latter half of the 6th cent. A.D.

** His Life**— There is a legend according to which Kalidasa was a boor by birth, but was somehow married to an obstinate princess who abandoned him finding that he had no education at all. Thereupon he devoted himself to the worship of Kali who blessed him with literacy and poesy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 1. धन्वन्तरिक्षपणकामरसिंहशङ्कुवेतालभट्टघटकर्परकालिदासाः।  
   ख्यातो वराहमिहिरो नृपतेः सभायां रत्नानि वै वररुचिर्नव विक्रमस्य॥

Thus he became Kali-dasa and a gifted poet by the favour of Kali. He then returned to his wife and she put him the question ‘अस्ति कश्चित् वागर्थः’in reply to which it is stated that he composed three stanzas beginning with the three words and that he later composed the three Kavyas, 1. Kumarasambhava 2. Meghaduta and 3. Raghuvamsa, with one of those words at the commencement of the first verses of them respectively. The legend is no doubt interesting but not reliable.

 We can gather some information about Kalidasa’s life from his own writings. His repeated reference to Ujjain indicates that he must have spent at least a part of his life in the city. His dwelling upon the charms of that city in his Meghadutam makes clear that he loved it much. His description of the Tour about the whole of India and even into the regions beyond the borders of India, in the Raghuvamsam, makes any one believe that Kalidasa himself must have made such a grand tour. Mountains seem to have impressed him deeply. As acutely observed by a critic, he is the only Sanskrit poet who has described a certain flower which is exclusively Kasmirian.

 There cannot be any doubt that Kalidasa had extensive education and that he had mastered rhetoric, dramatic theory and the science of grammar ‘the chief of all sciences.’Besides the knowledge of law and astronomy, he seems to have had proficiency in the profound and subtle systems of philosophy. If his Kumarasambhavam is shivaistic, his Raghuvamsam is Vishnuite. If the hymn to Vishnu in the latter work is expressing Vedantic monism, the hymn to Brahma in the former expresses the dualism of the Samkhyas. The Buddhism and Yoga doctrines are also mentioned here and there. Therefore we may observe that,

in matters of religion and philosophy, Kalidasa was of an unbiased mind.

** His works**:— More than forty works are generally attributed to Kalidasa, but critics acknowledge only seven or eight of them as his. Those works are—

 1—3. Three dramas— 1.Sakuntalam, 2.Vikramorvasiyam, and 3.Malavikagnimitram.

 4—5. Two Mahakavyas— 1. Raghuvamsam and2. Kumarasambhavam.

 6. One Khanda Kavya— 1. Meghadutam.

 7. कुन्तेश्वरदौत्यम्– Not yet discovered, but known by a quotation in the औचित्यविचारचर्चा of Kshemendra.

 8. ऋतुसंहारम्— A descriptive poem accepted by some as the work of Kalidasa.

 **His Poetry**:—In the translation of Prof. A.W. Ryder, this is what Bana, the celebrated Sanskrit novelist says about Kalidasa’s verse:—

“Where find a soul that does not thri॥  
In Kalidasa’s verse to meet  
The smooth, inevitable lines.  
Like blossom-clusters, honey sweet?”

 “उपमा कालिदासस्य”has been a very common saying in appreciation of Kalidasa’s abundant and homely similes. Jayadeva describes him as ‘the grace of poetry’—‘कालिदासो विलासः’.It is this grace of Kalidasa’s composition that induced the celebrated critic Schlegel assign for him a very high position amongst the galaxy of the “Sons of Song.”

 Kalidasa is undoubtedly “the brightest star in the firmament of Indian Poetry.”‘The richness of his creative fancy and his skill in expressing tender sentiment and sympathy with nature gives him a very high place among the world’s dramatic poets.’

**RAGHUVAMSA—CANTO XVI.**

**Notes**

 \[In four cantos commencing with this, Kalidasa relates the story of the descendants of Rama. The story of Rama, which he has related in seven cantos ending with the 15th is almost on the lines of Valmiki’s Ramayana. But it is difficult to point out with authority any particular work as the source for the story told in the rest of Raghuvamsa.\]

** 1.** अथ— After the departure of Rama (related in the last sloka of the previous canto). इतरे सप्तरघुप्रवीराः— The seven eminent princes other than Kusa, viz.—(1) लव brother of Kusa; (2-3) तक्षक and पुष्कर (Bharata’s sons); (4-5) अङ्ग and चन्द्रकेतु (Lakshmana’s sons); and (6-7) शत्रुघाती and सुबाहु (Satrughna’s sons). सौभ्रात्रम्=शोभना भ्रातरः—सुभ्रातरः; तेषां भावः. \[सुभ्रातृ+अण्, as the base of the word belongs to the युवादि group. The affix is in accordance with ‘हायनान्तयुवादिभ्योऽण्’– Panini V i 130.\]

 **2.** सेतु वार्ता…..—Here. वार्ता= agriculture, protection of cattle etc.; compare these with—“कृषिर्वणिक्पथो दुर्गं सेतुः कुञ्जरबन्धनम्। खन्याकरधनादानं शून्यानां च निवेशनम्। अष्टवर्गमिमं साधुः स्वयं वृद्धोऽपि वर्धयेत्”—कामन्दकनीतिसारे, V *77f.*

 **3.** चतुर्भुजः— The four-armed Vishnu. चत्वारः भुजाः यस्य सः; or भुङ्क्ते इति भुजः, चतुर्णां धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणां भुजः,दानप्रवृत्तेः= (1) from the occupation of charity, (2) ... flow of ichor. सुरद्विपानां—सुराणां द्विपाः, तेषां; the celestial elephants; the guardian elephants of the quarters, which are eight in number, *cf.*—ऐरावतः पुण्डरीको वामनः कुमुदोऽञ्जनः। पुष्पदन्तः सार्वभौमः सुप्रतीकश्च दिग्गजाः—Amara). Note that this number eight agrees with the number of the princes which is also eight, inclusive of Kusa. सामयोनिः= सामानि योनिःयस्य. The दिग्गजाऽ are believed

to have sprung up from the hymns of the सामवेद. In suppor of this belief Mallinatha in his commentary quotes the following from पालकाप्य—“सूर्यस्याण्डकपाले द्वे समानीय प्रजापतिः हस्ताभ्यां परिगृह्याथ सप्त सामान्यगायत। गायतो ब्रह्मणस्तस्मात् समुत्पेतुर्मतङ्गजाः”अष्टधा—The affix धा is added to the numeral अष्ट, in the sense of ‘the manner or mode of an action’in accordance with the rule “संख्याया विधेर्धाल्”—Panini V iii 42.

 **4.** अथ marks the opening of a new topic. अर्धरात्रे—अर्धंरात्रेः अर्धरात्रः, तस्मिन्. Note here that अर्धं meaning half isalways neuter and forms the first member of the compoundthe compound word however is masculine and अकारान्त, by the rules 1. ‘रात्राह्नाहाः पुंसि’—(II iv 29) & ‘अहः सर्वैकदेशसंख्यातपुण्याच्च रात्रेः’—(V iv. 87). स्तिमितप्रदीपे and सुप्तजने qualify शय्यागृहे. प्रवास.. वेषां-प्रवासे तिष्ठति इति प्रवासस्थः, तस्य कलत्रं; प्रवासस्थकलत्रस्य वेष इव वेषःयस्याः सा; ताम्. Indian women are generally described as neglecting their toilet, decorations etc. when their husbands are away from them on journey. This is the most common feature of a Virahini. Kalidasa gives a very graphic picture of a Virahini in his Meghaduta II 10–27. अदृष्टपूर्वां- न दृष्टा पर्वं, ताम्.

 **5.** साधु... ऋद्धेः–साधुभिः साधारणा, पार्थिवस्य ऋद्धिः; साधुसाधारणा पार्थिवर्धिः यस्य सः, तस्य. पुरुहूतभासः—पुरूणि हूतानि (नामानि) अस्य— (Indra); पुरुहूतस्य इव भाः यस्य सः, तस्य जयशब्दपूर्वं—जयशब्दः पूर्वः(अस्मिन् कर्मणि) यथा तथा. बन्धुमतः—प्रशस्ता बन्धवः अस्य इति बन्धुमान्, तस्य.

 **6.** अथ– after her sight. अनपोढार्गलम्–न अपोढम् अर्गलम् यस्य तत्. छायां– reflection, image. The simile here is graphic. Just as a reflexion enters the mirror (without finding any doorway) she had entered the apartment through no doorway i.e., without opening the door. पूर्वार्धविसृष्टतल्पः—पूर्वार्धेन बिसृष्टः तल्पः येन.

** 7.** आवरण is a door here, (आव्रियते अनेन द्वारम् इति). अनिर्वृतानां— of those in distress. है= हिमकृतम्.

** 8.** परिग्रहः—wife. This word has been used in this text several times to convey various meanings— *cf.* IX 46, XI 55, XIII 36, XII 16, XV 55, XVIII 38. वशिनां=जितेन्द्रियाणां. परस्त्रीविमुखप्रवृत्ति= परेषां स्त्रीषु (विषये) विमुखा प्रवृत्तिः यस्य तत्.

** 9.** पुरःis the possessive singular of पूः—city, which is in the feminine gender.

** 10.** वस्वौकसारा is taken to mean the city of Alaka, the capital of Kubera, on the basis of the यादवकोश— “अलकापुरी वस्वौकसारा स्यात्”. It may also refer to Indra’s capital on the basis of a line in the विष्णुपुराण.viz., ‘वस्वौकसारा शक्रस्य’. The word may also be interpreted thus—बसूनां (रत्नानां) ओकैः(सद्मभिः) सारा ( श्रेष्ठा). \[Note that ओकस् is treated as ओक (ending in अ) by क्षीरस्वामी.\] समग्रशक्तौ.endowed with all the three regal powers; viz. प्रभावशक्ति, उत्साहशक्ति and मन्त्र (counsel) शक्ति. सूर्यवंशे भवः— सूर्यवंश्यः.

 **11.** There is very little difference in the meaning of the words तल्पand अट्ट. Amara treats them as synonymous. (‘तल्पं शय्याट्टदारेषु’इत्यमरः) So तल्प may be taken to mean the terrace of a house, and अट्टa turret. The reading विशीर्णकल्पाट्टशतः noticed by Mallinatha is better.

 **12.** अभिसारिकाणां—भर्तृसंकेतस्थानाभिमुखं सरन्ति इति अभिसारिकाः.*i.e.*women who go to meet their lovers at appointed places; c*f.* कान्तार्थिनी तु या याति संकेत साभिसारिका— Amara. शिवाभिः is qualified by नदन्मुखोल्काविचितामिषाभिः; नदन्ति च तानि मुखानि, तेभ्यः निर्गताः उल्काः, ताभिः विचितं आभिषं याभिः ताः, ताभिःThe she-jackals of a particular type are believed to emit flames of fire while howling: the reference made above is to these flames with the help of which they search for flesh.

 **13.** दीर्घिका—a long or oblong lake. *Cf.* शुशुभिरे......। विकचतानसरसा गृहदीर्घिका मदकलोदकलोलविहङ्गमाः. Raghu. IX 39.

 **14.** वृक्षे शेरते इति वृक्षेशयाः; the locative of वृक्षे is retained even in the compound by the rule ‘शयवासवासिष्वकालात्’—Panini VI iii.18, which means that the locative ending is retained before शय, बासand वासिन् in a compound if the ending does not denote time; the अच् affix in… शयः is by the rule ‘अधिकरणे शेतेः’(III ii.15) which prescribes it for शी- to lie down, when it is compounded with a case-inflected word indicating location. दवस्य उल्काभिः हतेभ्यः शेषाणि वर्हाणि येषां ते–दवोल्काहतं शेषवर्हाः. क्रीडार्थं मयूराः—क्रीडामयूराः.

 **15.**हताः न्यङ्कवःयैः तैः—हतन्यङ्कुभिः न्यङ्कु is a kind of deer. *Cf.* ‘न्यङ्कुर्मृगे मुनौ...’–हेमचन्द्र। अस्रैःदिग्धं—अस्रांदग्धं. For अस्र= blood, *cf.* “रुधिरेऽसृग्लोहितास्र...”– Amara. दिग्ध is the past participle of दिह्.

 **16.** चित्रगताः द्विपाः—चित्रद्विपाः=painted elephants. नखा एवाङ्कुशाः,, तेषाम् आघातैः विभिन्नाः कुम्भाः येषां ते—नखाङ्कुशाघातविभिन्नकुम्भाः.

 **17.** योषितां प्रतियातनानि—योषित्प्रतियातनानि.Here प्रतियातनrefers to the figures (carved on the pillars).*Cf.* प्रतिमानं प्रतिविम्बं प्रतिमा प्रतियातना प्रतिच्छाया—Amara. उत्क्रान्ताः वर्णानां क्रमाः (अत एव) धूसराः, तासां-उत्कान्तवर्णक्रमधूसराणां निर्मोकपट्टाः–निर्मोका एव पट्टाः, cloths in the form of the sloughs of serpents.

 **18.** कालान्तरश्यामसुधेषु—कालस्य अन्तरः, तेन श्यामा सुधा येषु, तेषु. नक्तं (रात्रौ) is an indeclinable. रूढतृणाङ्कुरेषु—रूढाः तृणानाम् अङ्कुराः येषु तेषु. मुक्तागुणशुद्धयः–मुक्तानां गुणाः, तेषां शुद्धिरिव शुद्धिः येषां ते. चन्द्रपादाः–Moon’s rays. *Cf.* ‘पादा रश्म्यङ्घ्रितुर्यांशाः’—Amara.

 **19.** आवर्ज्य—Indeclinable past participle of आ+वृज् (I Paras.) मम इमाः—मदीयाः वन्यैः पुलिन्दैरिव वानरैः—by the wild pulindas and monkeys as well. Here इवmay also be taken

to show the similarity between the pulindas and monkeys, in which case the translation will have to read— ‘by the wild monkey-like pulindas’.

 **20.**न आविष्कृताःदीपानां भासः येषु ते—अनाविष्कृतदीपभासः. दिवा (by day) indeclinable. गवाक्षाः—गावः(rays) अक्षन्ति (penetrate) अनेन इति. विच्छिन्नधूमप्रसराः—विच्छिन्नःधूमानां प्रसरः येषां ते. This is to indicate that the houses were deserted.

 **21.** बलिक्रियाभिः वर्जितानि सैकतानि येषां तानि— बलिक्रियावर्जितसैकतानि बलि— flowers offered in worship. ‘बलिःपूजोपहारः स्यात्’—शाश्वत kosa. स्नान्ति अनेन इति स्नानीयं (चूर्णं). उपान्तेषु वानीरगृहाणि येषां तानि—उपान्तवानीरगृहाणि. दूये Ising. agrees with its subject अहं (understood).

 **22.** अर्हू is used to express a polite request. कुलस्य राजधानी—कुलराजधानी. राजधानी is derived in two ways: (1) राज्ञा धीयते अस्याम् इति and (2) धीयते अस्यामिति धानी, राज्ञःधानी राजधानी.The simile indicates that Ayodhya is his real abode just a Rama’s real form was that of Vishnu, while others wetonly temporary.

 **23.** प्रतीतः— pleased. प्राग्रहरः–foremost or chief. प्रकृष्टमग्र प्राग्रं, प्राग्रे हरतीति प्राग्रहरः, *cf.* विश्वावसुप्राग्रहरैःप्रवीणैः—Kumara. VII 48.

 **24.** The king related all that took place between him and the presiding deity of Ayodhya to the Brahmins, as the whole thing looked a dream while reflecting upon it. Gargya lays a rule that an auspicious dream should always be related to good people to secure their blessings also. *Cf.*

दृष्ट्वा स्वप्नंशोभनं नैव सुप्यात्पश्चाद्दृष्टो यः स पाकंविधत्तेI  
शंसेदिष्टं तत्र साधुर्द्विजेभ्यस्ते चाशीर्भिः प्रीणयेयुर्नरेन्द्रम्॥

 **25.** श्रोत्रियसात्— Here the affix सात् is used to indicate that something is made over to a master or superior person. A श्रोत्रिय is a Brahmin well-read in the Vedas. *Cf.* जन्मना

ब्राह्मणो ज्ञेयः संस्कारैर्द्विज उच्यते। विद्यया यातिविप्रत्वं त्रिभिः श्रोत्रिय उच्यते। and Amara—श्रोत्रियश्छान्दसौ समौ। Mallinatha quotes Panini V ii 84 ‘श्रोत्रियंश्छन्दोऽधीते’in support of this. प्रतस्थे III sing. of स्था with प्र in the perfect tense. The root स्थाis always a Parasmai, but has taken the Atmane terminations by virtue of its association with the upasarga प्र, by the rule समवप्रविभ्यःस्थः

 **26.** सेना=सह इनेन, accompanied by the lord. रथोदारगृहाः–रथा एव उदारा गृहाः यस्याः सा. Here उदारis used in the sense of ‘splendid.’जङ्गमा च असौराजधानी च- जङ्गमराजधानी. जङ्गमा—ever in motion, moving. For the formation of राजधानी see notes on sl. 22.

 **27.** आतपत्राभलमण्डलेन—(आतपात् त्रायते इति आतपत्रम्) आतपत्रमेव अमलं मण्डलम् (बिंबं) यस्य, तेन. The flat and bright umbrella spread out resembles the disc of the Moon, with the difference that the Moon’s disc is समल while the disc of the umbrella is अमल. बलौघः—बलानां ओघः(flow, or rush).

 **28.** वरूथिनीनां—वरूथाः (armours etc.) सन्ति अस्याम् इति वरूथिनी, तासाम्. *Cf.* वरूथिनी वलं सैन्यम्–Amara. विष्णुपदं— विष्णोः पदं. *Cf.‘*वियद्विष्णुपदं वापि पुस्याकाशविहायसी’–Amara. The word means ‘sky’as it formed the second stride of Vishnu as Vamana.

 **29.** उद्यच्छमाना- preparing to go. Note that यम् preceded by सम्, उद् or आ will have to be treated as Atmane, when it does not refer to a book and when it conveys the result of the action indicated by the verb to the agent. (Vide Panini- “समुदाङ्भ्योयमोऽग्रन्थे”). निवेश is a halting place while marching. सामग्यमतिं—(समग्रस्य भावःसामग्यं) सामग्यस्य मतिः, ताम्.

 **30.** द्विपानां—द्वाभ्यां (शुण्डातुण्डाभ्यां) पिबति इति द्विपः, तेषां. तुरङ्गमाणांतुरेण (त्वरया) गच्छति इति तुरंगमः(तुरगःalso) तेषां. रेणुः प्रपेदे etc., implies the vastness of the army.

(1) गिरौ शेते इति गिरिशः। This form is permitted only in Vedas and not in classical works. (2) गिरिः अस्ति अस्य निवासत्वेन इति गिरिशः.

Some take the word विशांपतिः as an अलुक् compound.

 **81.** त्रयोलोकाःत्रैलोक्यम् \[त्रिलोक+य (ष्यञ्)\]; त्रैलोक्यस्य नाथः प्रभवः यस्य तं—त्रैलोक्यनाथप्रभवम्। अस्त्रविद्वान् cannot be a genitive tatpurusha on account of a technical objection (“न लोकाव्ययनिष्ठाखलर्थतृनाम्”— II iii 69—एषां प्रयोगे षष्ठी न स्यात्)। Hence it is to be an accu. Tat. अस्त्रं विद्वान्। मानेन उन्नतं तेन—मानोन्नतेन। मूर्ध्नि अभिषिक्तं—मूर्धाभिषिक्तं. The अभिषेक is an essential ceremony at the time of crowning a king.

of Canterbury sprinkles water over the king and annoints him.

 **82.** कार्यान्तर= कार्यार्ध and not अन्यकार्य। विष्णोः सुताख्यां etc.—for this belief namely that the son is a part and parcel of the father *cf.* the Sruti—आत्मा वै पुत्रनामासि। आराधयितुं योग्यः—आराधनीयः।

**RAGHUVAMSA—Canto XVI**

**(English Translation)**

 1. Then, the seven other great heroes (princes) of the Raghu family made Kusa, the eldest (among them) by virtue of earlier birth and good qualities, the receptacle of every extraordinary precious thing; for, good brotherly affection was in accordance with their family (heritage).

 2. Although they had risen to very high power by their never unsuccessful undertakings, the chief of which were (construction of) bridges, (spread of) agriculture, and arresting elephants, yet they did not transcend the boundary of the parts of land divided amongst them, like the oceans which never transgress their coast line.

 3. That family of those (princes), which had sprung from the portions of the four-armed god (Vishnu) who never desisted from the occupation of charity, spread wide being divided into eight branches like the family of the celestial elephants born of the Samans and of uninterrupted flow of ichor.

 4. Once at midnight, Kusa, who was awake in his bed-chamber, the inmates of which were all asleep and the lamps wherein were steadily burning, beheld a lady, never seen before, in the dress of a wife whose husband is on tour.

 5. Having first uttered the words ‘victory to you’, she folded her hands standing before him, a vanquisher of his foes, whose royal fortune was commonly shared by all the virtuous, whose splendour was like that of Indra and who had eminent brothers.

 6. Thereupon, full of astonishment, that son of Rama having raised his upper half from the bed, addressed her who,

like the reflection on the surface of a mirror, had entered his chamber although the bolts of its doors were not removed.—

 7.“Although (my) chamber is closed you have gained entrance into it, and yet no yogic power is noticed in you; further you bear an appearance of an unhappy person, like a lotus blighted by frost.

 8. “Who are you, good lady? or, rather, whose wife are you? and what is the object in your coming to me? Tell me (all this) remembering that the mind of the self-restrained Raghus is such that its disposition is wholly averse to (any love of) the wives of other men.”

 9. She addressed him (thus)— “Know me, o king, to be the presiding deity, now lordless, of that city which is faultless and the citizens of which were taken away with him by your sire anxious to repair to his abode (Vaikuntha).

 10. “I, of such description, having surpassed Indra’s city (of Alaka) formerly by (my) riches manifested in the series of festivals held on account of the excellent rule (of your sire), have (now) attained this pitiable plight although you, a scion of the solar race, are ruling here with full power.

 11. “Without a lord, my situation with its hundreds of shattered turrets and terraces and dilapidated ramparts, resembles the close of the day with the sun sunk behind the setting mountain and the clouds dispersed by a terrible wind.

 12. “The royal road which had been the pathway during nights for Abhisarikas with bright jingling anklets, is now traversed along by female jackals that seek carrion by the aid of the light emitted from their howling mouths.

 13. “The water of lakes which (formerly) imitated the deep resounding of a drum, being stirred by the foreparts of

the hands of young ladies, now cries hoarsely being struck violently with horns by wild buffaloes.

 14. “The pet peacocks (now) lying on trees as their abodes of perching-rods are broken, devoid of their dance on account of the absence of tabor-sounds and possessing only the remnant of their plumes consumed by wild fire are reduced to the state of wild ones.

 15. “And on those flights of steps where (at one time) the fair ladies planted their feet dyed in lac, the blood-smeared paws are now placed by tigers that have just killed the deer.

 16. “The elephants in painting shown to have descended into a bed of lotuses and as having pieces of lotus stalks offered to them by the female elephants, now bear the attacks of the enraged lions as their frontal globes are torn out by the strokes of the goad-like claws (of lions).

 17. “The strips of sloughs left on pillars by serpents become on account of their adherence (to them), a covering garment on the breasts of the (carved) female images looking dusky with a faded paint of colour (on them).

 18. “Those very rays of the moon, though white like strings of pearls, do not get intensified at night on the mansions whose plaster has turned black owing to lapse of time and on which shoots of grass have grown here and there.

 19. “Those garden-creepers of mine, the flowers of which were (at one time) plucked by sportive women gently (lit. compassionately) bending their boughs, are now handled roughly by the wild pulindas and monkeys as well.

 20. “The windows which throw out no light of lamps at night, and which are bereft of the splendour of the faces of beautiful women during day, are now screened by the webs of

insects as the volumes of smoke (of incense) have ceased to issue forth from them.

 21. “I am grieved to see the Sarayu-waters not obtaining the admixture of the perfumed powders used while bathing, their beds of sand devoid of the offerings of worship, and the cane-bowers on their borders deserted.

 22. “Therefore, it behoves you to leave this abode and to repair to me, the capital of your lineage just as your sire returned to the state (lit. form) of the supreme soul (Vishnu) having abandoned his purposely assumed human form.”

 23. The foremost of the descendants of Raghu, being delighted, granted her request saying ‘Be it so.’ The (presi- ding deity of the) city too, on whose countenance a smile of satisfaction was clearly visible, disappeared with her bodily frame.

 24. Next morning the king related that wonderful event of the night to Brahmanas in the assembly; having heard that, they congratulated him on his having been chosen as her lord personally by the (goddess of the) hereditary capital.

 25. Having made over Kusavati to Brahmins versed in Vedas, on a day suited for journey he set out with the ladies of his harem for Ayodhya, and was followed by his armies like wind by clusters of clouds.

 26. During his march, the army became his moving capital having the chariots for its stately mansions and the rows of banners for its gardens containing sport-hills in the form of huge elephants.

 27. The flood of the forces despatched to the land of (their) former abode by him having the disc of a white umbrella (held above him) looked like the ocean pushed on to the

shores— its original place, by the just-risen moon whose disc is as white as an umbrella.

 28. As if not sufficiently able to bear the pressure of the armies of him who was marching onwards, the earth under the guise of the vast cloud of dust ascended, as it were, the second tract of Vishnu.

 29. The army, seen in whichever of its three sections viz., preparing for a march having halted behind, camping in halting stations in front, and moving along its course, produced the impression that it was the entire army.

 30. On account of the sprinkling of the ichor of elephants and the strokes from the hoofs of the horses of that leader (Kusa), the dust on the road was turned into mud and the mud also got reduced to the state of dust.

 31. While seeking for a passage through the valleys of the Vindhya mountain, that army, like the Reva, being divided into various squadrons (branches) and making a loud clamour (roar) caused the mouths of the caves resound with echoes.

 32. That king, whose chariots had the rims of their wheels turned red by crushing the minerals (on the way) and the sound of whose trumpets got mingled with the din of the march, crossed the Vindhya mountain, just glancing at the presents brought to him by the Pulindas (on his way).

 33. To him, crossing the Ganges which flowed backwards in consequence of the construction of a bridge of elephants at its fordable part, the flamingoes flapping their wings to soar into the sky became chamaras obtained without effort.

 34. He bowed down to the water of that three-streamed

river, which was undulated by (moving) boats and which was the means of attaining heaven in the case of his forefathers whose bodies were made to remain in the state of ashes by Kapila through wrath.

 35. After travelling thus for some days, having arrived at the bank of Sarayu at the end of (his) journey, Kusa beheld hundreds of sacrificial posts fixed at altars, belonging to the Raghus who had performed sacrifices in large numbers.

 36. The breeze from the interior of the gardens of his ancestral capital, having shaken the branches of the flowery trees and having touched the cool waves of Sarayu, went forth to receive him whose army was tired (by the journey).

 37. Then that powerful king the banner of his family, who had an arrow planted in (the hearts of) his foes and was a friend to his cit zens, encamped those forces (of his) with wavy banners on the outskirts of the city.

 38. Multitudes of artists employed by the king made that (dilapidated) city altogether a new one by virtue of their being equipped with all expedients, just as the clouds make the sun-scorched earth quite fresh by a downpour of waters.

 39. Thereafter the foremost hero of the Raghu race had the worshipful ritual performed with animal sacrifices offered to the capital containing splendid statue-houses, through priests who were versed in the Vastu rites and had observed fasts.

 40. Just as a lover enters the heart of his beloved, having entered the city palace to which the attribute ‘Royal’ is prefixed, he suitably honoured all his followers assigning them other mansions in accordance with their ranks.

 41. With horses resting in stables, with elephants fas-

tened to the posts fixed properly in their resting grounds and with the saleable articles arranged in the shops, that city appeared like a lady having ornaments arranged on all her limbs.

 42. The son of Maithili, living in that residence of the Raghus which was restored to its former splendour, did not envy (the lot of either) the lord of heaven or the king of Alaka.

 43. Then came the hot season to instruct, as it were, his beloved ladies in point of dress in which the upper garments were interwoven with jems, the necklaces were hanging over their extremely pale breasts and the garments of silk were (so light as) to be blown away by a breath.

 44. The sun having come near returning from the (winter) solstice (the point in the sky marked by the Agastya star), the northern quarter began to send forth a stream of snow belonging to the Himalayas, as though it were a flow of tears cool with joy.

 45. The day with its heat increased excessively and the night attenuated extremely, looked like the couple of a husband and wife estranged by a contrary behaviour but filled with remorse afterwards.

 46. The water of the house-ponds gradually sinking down from the rows of steps covered with moss had the stalks of its lotuses risen up and became only so deep as to reach the hips of women.

 47. In the woods the black bee, having set its foot witha hum on each of the buds of the evening jasmine creepers emitting fragrance by blooming, counted their number, as it were.

 48. The Sirisha flower, although slipped from the ear of amorous women, did not drop down at once as it had its filaments stuck fast to their cheek marked with the recent nail-scratches filled with perspiration.

 49. The rich men passed the heat of summer in shower-houses reposing on special (seats of) stones washed with sandal-juice and surrounded by cool sprays of water poured out by fountains.

 50. The God of love, whose vigour had gone down by the passing away of Vasanta, acquired power from the tresses of young women which were let loose being wet by bathing and in which the evening jasmine flowers were interwoven after they (tresses) had been fumigated (with incense-smoke).

 51. The long sprout of the Arjuna tree, a little gold coloured on account of its bearing the pollen, looked as it were the bowstring of the Mind-born (God of love), broken by Siva through rage even after having burut his body.

 52. By the closing part of the sultry season all its sins against amorous people were made amends for by bringing together at one and the same time the splitting of the mango blossoms, old wine of sugarcane juice and the new trumpet flower, —all of a delightful smell.

 53. In that excessively hot season two things were particularly delightful to the people, viz., the king and the moon standing in their rise, a resort to whose feet and rays was capable of removing misery and the heat of summer respectively.

 54. One day there arose in him a desire to sport accom. panied by women, in the water of the Sarayu which was delightful in the hot season, which had intoxicated royal

swans swimming unsteadily on its waves and which carried with it the flowers of the creepers growing on its banks.

 55. He, having the prowess of the disc-bearer Vishnu, began to sport in a manner befitting his wealth and greatness in that river on the level grounds of whose banks tents were pitched, and from which the alligators had been taken out by fishermen.

 56. That river (Sarayu) had its swans disturbed by young ladies who were striking their armlets against each other’s because of their descending the flight of steps on the bank and whose steps were accompanied by the jingling of the anklets.

 57. The king, seated in a boat and observing the eagerness for bathing of those ladies who were engaged in dashing water against each other, spoke to the Kirata woman who stood by his side holding a chamara (in her hand).—

 58. “Behold the stream of the Sarayu which, being waded through by the hundreds of women of my harem whose unguents are dissolved (in the water), presents a variety of colours like the rise of the twilight together with clouds.

 59. “The collyrium (in the eyes) of the beautiful ladies of the harem which was washed away by the waters agitated by boats has been restored to them by the waters which unite with their eyes the beauty of a flush of intoxication.

 60. “These young women, unable to support (balance) their bodies properly on account of their heavy hips and breasts, swim although with difficulty in water with their arms having tight fitted armlets, purely out of passion for sport.

 61. “These ear ornaments of sirisha blossoms of the females sporting in the waters falling into the stream of the

river and floating about deceive the fish that are anxious to devour moss.

 62. “The necklaces of these women absorbed in dashing the water, although broken, is not noticed as being shattered among the sprays that vie with pearls rising up to their breasts.

 63. “The standards of comparison of the beauty and different limbs of these sportive women are close by;— viz., the beauty of the whirlpools for the graceful form of the deep navels, the waves for the eyebrows and the pairs of chakravakas for the breasts.

 64. “The agreeable sound of the taborlike water, which is in consonance with the singing of these ladies and hailed with delight by the sweet-cooing peacocks on the slopes of the banks with their plumages spread out, fills our ears.

 65. “These girdle-strings (of the damsels), with the intervals between their threads filled with water and equalling (in appearance) stars bedimmed by moonlight owing to the hips of the women having the wet garments sticking to them, have assumed silence.

 66. “These young damsels by whom streams of waters are dashed upwards with their hands and who are drenched (with water) on their faces by friends out of joy, shower down drops of water red with the red (kunkum) powder from the ends of their curly tresses of hair now straightened (by being wet).

 67. “The appearance of these young women’s faces, although disturbed by the water-sport, is yet charming indeed with the loosened hair, the washed off amorous paintings and the loosely hanging pearl-ear-rings.”

 68. The king whose necklace was swinging about, having got down from his balloon-like boat sported with those women in water just as a lordly wild elephant having an uprooted lotus plant clinging to its shoulder sports with female elephants.

 69. Then those women, accompanied by the resplendent king, appeared exceedingly beautiful; pearls are already (by nature) charming to the eyes; what to say when they have gained; (association with) a sapphire shooting forth its rays.

 70. The long eyed damsels sprinkled him with coloured water ejected through gold syringes, out of love (for him). Being in that state, he shone very much like the lord of mountains having (all over him) springs of water containing metallic earth.

 71. Indra, who surrounded by heavenly nymphs sports in the celestial Ganges, had that grace (of his) imitated by the king bathing in that excellent river (Sarayu), accompanied by the young women of his harem.

 72. The Victory-bringing ornament of the king which Rama having obtained from Agastya had bestowed on him (Kusa) together with the kingdom, dropping down unnoticed sank in water.

 73. Having bathed to his heart’s content in the company of his wives, he had just gone into the tent pitched on the bank when, even before he had put on his dress, he found his arm devoid of the celestial armlet.

 74. He did not endure its loss, not because of greed but because it was the charm of (i.e. for securing) the goddess of victory worn before also by his father; for, grave as he was, ornaments and flowers were all the same (to him).

 75. Thereupon for its search he ordered all fishermen

skilled in diving into a river; they after having dived into the Sarayu being unsuccessful in their labours, spoke to him thus with unfaded facial brightness.—

 76. “Effort was made; but o king! your excellent ornament sunk into water was not found; evidently it has been taken away out of curiosity by Kumuda, a Naga who lives inside a deep pool of water (in the river).”

 77. Thereupon, that mighty bowman, with his eyes red with anger, having gone to the bank took up after stringing his bow, the missile presided over by Garuda for the destruction of that Naga.

 78. The moment it was fixed (on the bow) that deep pool of water, with its wavy bands tossed up through agitation and dashing against the banks, roared furiously like a wild elephant fallen into a pit, stretching forth its waving trunk in agitation and dashing violently against the sides (of the pit).

 79. Out of that pool, the crocodiles of which were all agitated, there arose instantly the serpent king leading before him a maiden, just as the tree (Parijata) of Indra sprang up. along with Lakshmi out of the ocean that was being churned.

 80. Seeing him standing nearby and bearing in his hands the ornament to be restored, the ruler of men withdrew his Sauparna (Garuda) missile; for, good men are not obstinate in their anger towards the humble.

 81. Kumuda who knew the power of the missile, with a head although elevated through pride having bowed down to Kusa, the son of the lord of the three worlds, who was a goad of his enemies through his power, and who was duly consecrated on his head as king, spoke (to him) thus—

 82. “I know you to be of an unrivalled form called the ‘son’of that Vishnu who had assumed a human form for a purpose. Such a one as I am, how shall I cause disturbance to the peace of mind of you, adorable as you are.

 83. “This maiden, whose ball had gone up by a stroke of (her) hand, having beheld your victorious ornament fallingdown rapidly like a meteor from the sky, took it up out of great curiosity.

 84. “Hence, let this ornament obtain contact onceagain with your stout arm which is reaching down to theknees, which bears on it permanent marks of a series of strokes of the bowstring and which is like a protecting iron bar (of the gates) of the earth.

 85. “And further, o king! you will please not reject this younger sister of mine named Kumudvati, who wishes to atone for her own offence (against you) by a long service at your feet.”

 86. Kumuda, who said thus and presented the ornament to him, accompanied by his kinsmen united according to rules with the ornament of his family which was in the form of the maiden the king who had said in reply to him—‘You are a worthy relation.’

 87. When her hand bearing the auspicious wristlet of wool was held in front of the holy fire flaming upwards by the lord of the people for connubial companionship, there arose a celestial trumpet-sound pervading the extremities of the quarters; after that, wonderful clouds showered down richly fragrant flowers.

 88. Thus, the Naga having gained for his kinsman the son of Maithili, the own child of the lord of the three worlds, and Kusa too (having obtained) that fifth. descendant from Takshaka (as his kinsman),—the former gave up the fear from the son of Vinatā who had become his enemy by slaying his father, and the latter who was dear to the citizens ruled the earth where serpents had become harmless.

**End of Canto XVI in Raghuvamsa.**

**PROSODY**

**सानुस्वारश्च दीर्घश्च विसर्गी च गुरुर्भवेत्।  
वर्णः संयोगपूर्वश्चतथा पादान्तगोऽपि वा॥**

 A syllable (अक्षर) is a vowel, with or without a consonant. It is गुरु ‘long’ or लघु ‘short’ according as the vowel is long or short. For practical purposes a short syllable when followed by a conjunct consonant, Anusvara or visarga will be considered (long) ‘गुरु’. The last syllable of the pada of a stanza, although short is taken as long according to the exigency of metre. A लघुis usually denoted by the symbol U, while aगुरु by— marked above theletters; e. g.—र᳴घु᳴वं᳒शे᳒ म᳴हा᳒का᳒व्ये᳒.

 The Sanskrit stanzas consist of four padas or quarters, regulated by the number of either (1) the syllables or (2) syllabic instants i.e., मात्र s. The former type is called the वर्णवृत्त and the latter मात्राच्छन्दस् or जाति.

 For purposes of scanning, writers on prosody have devised eight ganas or syllabic feet each consisting of 3 syllables and distinguished from one another by the long or short syllables being in a particular order.They are—

‘य’गण ᳴᳒ ᳒Bacchius

‘र’ ” ᳒᳴᳒  Amphimacer     

‘त’” ᳒᳒᳴  Anti-bacchius     

‘भ’”᳒ ᳴᳴ Dactylus

‘ज’” ᳴ ᳒ ᳴ Amphibrachys

‘स’” ᳴ ᳴ ᳒ Anapoestus

‘म’” ᳒ ᳒ ᳒ Mollosus

‘न’” ᳴ ᳴ ᳴ Tribrachys

**आदिमध्यावसानेषु *यरता* यान्ति लाघवम्।  
*भजसा* गौरवं यान्ति *मनौ* तु गुरुलाघवम्।**

 Theवृत्त s are of three kinds—

 1. समवृत्त— all the four feet of the stanza are alike.

 2. अर्धसमवृत्त— alternate feet of the stanza are alike.

& 3.विषमवृत्त— the feet of the stanza are dissimilar.

 The vrittas (metres) are named differently according to the number and order of the long or short syllables. In the Raghuvamsa Canto XVI we come across four types of vrittas viz., (1) इन्द्रवज्रा (2) उपेन्द्रवज्रा (3) उपजाति and (4) मन्दाक्रान्ता.

 (1) इन्द्रवज्रा—(eleven syllables in each quarter )  
 *Def:* स्यादिन्द्रवज्रा यदि तौ जगौ गः  
 *Scan:*᳒ त᳒ ᳴। ᳒त᳒ ᳴। ᳴ज᳒ ᳴। ग᳒ ग᳒

 Stanzas—2, 5, 15, 17, 19, 35, 36, 41, 50, 51, 60 64, 66 and 79.

 *Scan:*᳴ ज᳒ ᳴। ᳒ त᳒ ᳴। ᳴ज᳒ ᳴। ग᳒ ग᳒

 Stanza— 39.

 (3) *उपजाति*—( eleven syllables in each quarter)  
 Def: अनन्तरोदीरितलक्ष्मभाजौ, पादौ यदीयावुपजातयस्ताः।  
 (इत्थं किलान्यास्वपि मिश्रितासु, वदन्ति जातिष्विदमेव नाम॥)

 \[When some padas of a stanza are of the the इन्द्रवज्रा and the others of उपेन्द्रवज्रा, the metre is called उपजाति. This is of fourteen varieties.\]

 Stanzas—1, 3, 4, 6-14, 16, 18, 20-34, 37-38, 40, 42-49, 52-59, 61-63, 65, 67-78 and 80-85.

 (4) वसन्ततिलका— (fourteen syllables in each quarter)  
 *Def:* उक्ता वसन्ततिलका तभजाजगौगः।  
    ᳒ त᳒ ᳴ । ᳒भ᳴ ᳴ । ᳴ ज᳒ ᳴। ᳴ ज᳒ ᳴ । ग᳒ ग᳒

 Stanza— 86.

 (5) मन्दाक्रान्ता—(Seventeen syllables in each quarter)
